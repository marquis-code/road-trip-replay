# App Work flow
A trip is stimulated when the passanger inputs his or her Origin and Destination on the app.

This location information is saved on the database. 

Submission of Location triggers a re-rendering of the page and also displaying of the Route path on the map.

On Re-rendering of the page, a get request is made to fetch the available trip created on the database and this data is displayed in a div.

When user clicks on the div, the trip route is created on the map and the passanger can move the Map Marker around the map.

When moving the map marker around the map, the longitude and latitude of this locations would be displayed on the screen.
